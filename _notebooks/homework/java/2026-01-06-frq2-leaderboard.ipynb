    "## FRQ Question\n",
    "\n",
    "This question involves a scoreboard for a game. The game is played between two teams who alternate turns so that at any given time, one team is active and the other team is inactive. During a turn, a team makes one or more plays. Each play can score one or more points and the team’s turn continues, or the play can fail, in which case no points are scored and the team’s turn ends. The Scoreboard class, which you will write, is used to keep track of the score in a game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scoreboard class contains a constructor and two methods.\n",
    "- The constructor has two parameters. The first parameter is a String containing the name of team 1, and the second parameter is a String containing the name of team 2. The game always begins with team 1 as the active team.\n",
    "- The recordPlay method has a single nonnegative integer parameter that is equal to the number of points scored on a play or 0 if the play failed. If the play results in one or more points scored, the active team’s score is updated and that team remains active. If the value of the parameter is 0, the active team’s turn ends and the inactive team becomes the active team. The recordPlay method does not return a value.\n",
    "- The getScore method has no parameters. The method returns a String containing information about the current state of the game. The returned string begins with the score of team 1, followed by a hyphen (\"-\"), followed by the score of team 2, followed by a hyphen, followed by the name of the team that is currently active."
