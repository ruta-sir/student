# Backend Development Experience: Gemini Chatbot API

## Overview

As part of my journey into backend development, I created my first API to power a **Gemini Chatbot** — a conversational assistant designed to respond to user queries. This project marked my transition from frontend familiarity to backend exploration, where I learned to build, test, and refine server-side logic using Java and Spring Boot.

## Learning Curve

Backend development was initially unfamiliar territory. Concepts like routing, HTTP methods, and API testing felt abstract compared to the visual nature of frontend work. But I was determined to understand it.

- I followed **tutorials**, read documentation, and explored community forums.
- I experimented with **Spring Boot annotations** like `@GetMapping` and `@PostMapping`.
- I used **Postman** to test endpoints and understand request/response cycles.

This hands-on approach helped me build confidence and deepen my understanding of backend architecture.

## My Role

- **API Design**: Built RESTful endpoints to handle chatbot interactions.
- **Routing Logic**: Used `@GetMapping` for retrieving data and `@PostMapping` for submitting user messages.
- **Testing with Postman**: Verified endpoint behavior, inspected JSON payloads, and debugged response formats.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented basic validation and response codes to guide users and developers.

## Example Endpoints

### `GET /chatbot/info`

Returns basic information about the Gemini Chatbot.

```java
@GetMapping("/chatbot/info")
public ResponseEntity<String> getInfo() {
    return ResponseEntity.ok("Gemini Chatbot v1.0 - Ready to assist!");
}
```
### `POST /chatbot/message`

Accepts a user message and returns a chatbot response.

```java
@PostMapping("/chatbot/message")
public ResponseEntity<String> handleMessage(@RequestBody String userMessage) {
    String reply = generateReply(userMessage);
    return ResponseEntity.ok(reply);
}
```


## Postman Testing Highlights
Using Postman, I was able to:
- Send GET requests to verify static responses.
- Submit POST requests with JSON bodies to simulate user input.
- Inspect headers, status codes, and response times.
- Debug unexpected behavior and refine endpoint logic.

## Key Takeaways
- Gained hands-on experience with Java Spring Boot and RESTful API design.
- Learned to use Postman as a powerful tool for backend testing and debugging.
- Overcame initial challenges by seeking out resources, staying curious, and iterating through trial and error.
- Built a functional chatbot backend that could be extended with NLP or database integration in future versions.
