# Frontend Development Experience: Solitaire Game Project

## Overview

As part of an interactive web-based solitaire game project, I contributed to the frontend development using **HTML** and **JavaScript**, with a focus on enhancing the educational experience for students learning programming fundamentals.

## My Role

- **Frontend Implementation**: Collaborated on the game's UI using semantic HTML and dynamic JavaScript to ensure a responsive and engaging interface.
- **Educational Integration**: Designed and implemented **multiple-choice questions (MCQs)** to reinforce key concepts after each lesson.
- **Reference Table Creation**: Built a **Future References Table** to help students understand and revisit essential JavaScript functions.

## MCQs for Student Learning

To support student retention and self-assessment, I created a series of MCQs that appear after completing each lesson. These questions were:

- **Contextual**: Directly tied to the lesson content (e.g., DOM manipulation, event handling).
- **Interactive**: Implemented using JavaScript to provide instant feedback.
- **Scalable**: Structured for easy expansion as new lessons are added.

### Example MCQ

<div class="mcq">
  <p>Which method is used to select an element by its ID?</p>
  <ul>
    <li onclick="checkAnswer(this)">getElementByClassName()</li>
    <li onclick="checkAnswer(this)">querySelector()</li>
    <li onclick="checkAnswer(this)">getElementById()</li> <!-- Correct -->
    <li onclick="checkAnswer(this)">getElementsByTagName()</li>
  </ul>
</div>
