# Overall Progress Reflection – AP CSA

## Growth Since the Beginning of the Year

At the start of the year, I was still getting comfortable with Java syntax, object-oriented principles, and debugging logic errors. Now, I can confidently write and troubleshoot both frontend and backend code, implement class hierarchies, and analyze complex problems methodically. My understanding of control structures, recursion, and data structures has deepened significantly, and I’ve developed a strong sense of design and code hygiene.

## N@tM Reflection

Night at the Museum (N@tM) was a great experience! I got to showcase my project and interact with visitors who were genuinely curious. One comment I really appreciated was:  
> "The UI was so good and easy to navigate.”  
Another person said:  
> "This presentation is very interactive, hooks in the audience greatly.”  
These comments validated my focus on both functionality and presentation.

## Next Steps for My Project

Given more time, I’d like to:
- Refactor the homepage layout to ensure buttons are styled consistently and only intended content appears.
- Add interactive elements to the featured projects section, like hover effects or modal previews.
- Implement a backend feature to store user feedback or ratings for each project.

## What I Want to Learn Next in CompSci

Next, I want to dive deeper into:
- **Data structures and algorithms** — especially sorting, searching, and graph traversal.
- **APIs and backend integration** — connecting frontend interfaces to real-time data.
- **Unit testing and debugging strategies** — to write more reliable and maintainable code.
- **Version control with Git** — for better collaboration and project tracking.
