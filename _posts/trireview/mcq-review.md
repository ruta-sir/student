# AP CSA Practice Exam 1 – MCQ Review

**Date Started:** Sunday, Nov 2, 8:32 PM  
**Total Time Spent:** 34 minutes 23 seconds  
**Score:** 35 / 42

## Strengths

- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Object-oriented programming (class design, access modifiers)
- String manipulation and array traversal

## Missed Questions Breakdown

| Q# | Topic | Skill(s) | Time | Issue | Correction | Approach |
|----|-------|----------|------|--------|------------|----------|
| 16 | Class diagram for `Book` class | 3.1, 3.3 | 2:57 | Misread UML diagram | Review class structure and relationships | Practice translating diagrams to code |
| 20 | Division and modulus in loop | 1.3, 2.7 | 0:13 | Miscalculated output | Revisit integer division/modulus | Trace loop iterations manually |
| 30 | Nested conditional in `minOfThree` | 2.4, 2.9 | 1:08 | Incorrect logic flow | Practice nested if-else logic | Write pseudocode before coding |
| 32 | 2D array to `ArrayList` conversion | 4.8, 4.12 | 1:09 | Misused `ArrayList` methods | Review nested loops and list syntax | Build small examples to test logic |
| 37 | Value returned by `enigma` method | 4.12, 4.13 | 0:21 | Misunderstood method behavior | Trace method step-by-step | Use dry-run tables for return values |
| 38 | Build `ArrayList` using `Scanner` | 4.6 | 0:27 | Scanner usage error | Review `Scanner` and input parsing | Practice reading input into collections |
| 39 | Recursive binary search | 4.17 | 0:20 | Misjudged base/recursive case | Revisit recursion fundamentals | Draw call stack diagrams |

## Correction Strategy

1. **Trace and Dry Run:** Simulate execution for logic-based questions.
2. **Diagram Practice:** Sketch UML diagrams and convert to code.
3. **Code Snippets:** Recreate missed problems in an IDE.
4. **Flashcards:** Key concepts like access modifiers, loop patterns, recursion.
5. **Group Review:** Discuss tricky questions with peers or teacher.

## Next Steps

- Reattempt missed questions with corrections.
- Practice similar problems from AP CSA prep books or online platforms.
- Track time per question to improve pacing.
