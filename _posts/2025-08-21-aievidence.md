# Skill: AI Evidence in Work

## Overview

My AI evidence in work demonstrates **systematic documentation of AI prompts, responses, and iterative improvement beyond AI output**. This skill showcases **my ability to effectively collaborate with AI tools, critically evaluate AI suggestions, and enhance AI-generated content**. Through this process, I learned to **craft effective prompts, analyze AI responses critically, identify limitations in AI output, and implement significant improvements beyond initial suggestions**. The progression includes AI tool exploration, prompt optimization, response evaluation, customization implementation, and quality enhancement through human insight.

## Evidence of Completion

Below are screenshots and documentation proving my effective AI collaboration and improvement:

### AI Prompt Development & Strategy

*(This screenshot shows documented AI prompts and strategic approach to AI interaction. I mainly utilized it for errors especially when my commits were failing and despite spending multiple hours trying to debug it, I was unable to)*

### AI Response Analysis & Evaluation

*(Despite trying to fix the failing commits multiple times, I was unable too. Since I have never been in this situation I asked AI for help and it suggested getting rid of all previous commits using git --force. This gave me a clean slate to start programming again. However, knowing that everything would get erased, I saved all of my previous code as files in a folder to ensure nothing was lost.)*

### Beyond AI: Custom Improvements

### Iterative AI Collaboration Process
