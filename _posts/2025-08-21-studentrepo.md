# Skill: Student Repository Creation

## Overview

My student repository creation journey demonstrates **evolution from basic template forking to building a personalized, well-organized repository with automated Actions**. This skill showcases **my ability to structure project repositories, implement version control best practices, and configure automated workflows**. Through this process, I learned to **fork and customize repository templates, organize file structures logically, configure GitHub Actions for automation, and maintain consistent documentation standards**. The progression includes template selection, initial setup, organizational improvements, automation implementation, and continuous repository maintenance.
