# Skill: VSCode Sharing and Collaboration

## Overview

My VSCode sharing and collaboration journey demonstrates **progression from individual coding ideas to collaborative development workflows**. This skill showcases **my ability to utilize VSCode Marketplace extensions like LiveShare and GitLens for real-time collaboration and version control visualization**. Through this process, I learned to **share development sessions with peers, navigate collaborative editing environments, analyze git history and contributions, and coordinate simultaneous coding efforts**. The progression includes mastering live session hosting, understanding branch visualization, implementing peer review workflows, and establishing effective communication during shared coding sessions.

## Evidence of Completion

Below are screenshots and documentation proving I successfully completed VSCode sharing and collaboration:
