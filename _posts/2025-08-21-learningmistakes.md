# Skill: Learning Through Mistakes

## Overview

My learning through mistakes journey demonstrates **comprehensive documentation of failures, thinking errors, technical errors, and iterative improvement processes**. This skill showcases **my ability to analyze failures systematically, implement debugging strategies, and transform setbacks into learning opportunities**. Through this process, I learned to **identify root causes of problems, document error patterns, develop debugging methodologies, and create systematic approaches to rework and improvement**. The progression includes mistake identification, error analysis, solution implementation, and process refinement for future prevention.

## Evidence of Completion

Below are screenshots and documentation proving my systematic approach to learning from mistakes:

### Error Documentation & Analysis

### Debugging Process Implementation

*(This demonstrates structured debugging approaches and problem-solving methodologies)*

### Learning Outcome Documentation
From struggling with the commits and having them constantly fail, I successfully learned how to git --force in order to override what is in my current github repository. This reset my github repo back to only what I had forked from the OCS student repo, giving me the room to start fresh, avoid mistakes that I previously made, and commit more often to prevent having to debug a lot of code in case the commit failed.
