# Skill: Hacks â€“ Tools & Equipment

## Overview

My tools and equipment hacks journey demonstrates **continuous learning, mistake identification, and iterative improvements** in development environment optimization. This skill showcases **my ability to research, experiment with, and refine development tools for enhanced productivity**. Through this process, I learned to **evaluate different development tools, troubleshoot configuration issues, document failed attempts and successful solutions, and optimize workflow efficiency**. The progression includes identifying pain points, researching solutions, implementing tool configurations, and iteratively improving based on practical experience.

## Evidence of Completion

Below are screenshots and documentation proving my learning journey with tools and equipment:

### Initial Tool Discovery

(This screenshot shows where I learned how to setup my MacOS for my computer)

### Configuration Attempts & Mistakes

(This demonstrates how I had to force remove all of my previous commits and restart from fresh on August 24th due to many errors. Before entering this class I realized I had many other tools such as astro and node.js that caused all of my commits to fail and forced me to restart everything including my mermaid flowchart and blog)

### Successful Implementation
